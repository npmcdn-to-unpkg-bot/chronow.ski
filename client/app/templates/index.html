    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="#" (click)="playName()">Jakub</a> and I'm a young web developer from Poland with a passion for creating beautiful accessible frontends and efficient backends for the web that your company can safely rely on.</p>
    <p>I love traveling and taking pictures wich you can see on my <a href="https://instagram.com/19kuba22">Instagram</a> profile. I've been to most countries of Europe already and I plan on traveling around the Canada, USA and Mexico this summer. I also love listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kuba-chronowski-1">music</a>, watching TV shows, reading and meeting new people ðŸ˜€</p>
    <p>I'm <a [routerLink]="['/Experience']">experienced</a> in both coding and project management as computers were my passion since the youngest age. I am proficient with Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and intermediate with C# and Java. I know frameworks like Angular, Bootstrap, Bourbon, Neat, Pylons, Pyramid, preprocessors like TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Sass or Less and I can manage both Linux and Windows servers. I really love to learn and take on new things so you can hit me up with virtually any challenge.</p>
    <p>I'm a student in Computer Science class of Technical High School of Mechatronics no. 1 in Warsaw. Iâ€™m proficient in written and spoken English and Polish, and Iâ€™m trying to teach myself Russian. Iâ€™ve received few certificates in various fields of IT which you can see in the <a [routerLink]="['/Education']">Education</a> section of the website. I love learning new stuff, but I prefer to do it practically and when itâ€™s interesting for me so I don't plan on going to college. I'll rather focus on self-development and broaden my experience by work and if it doesn't work out I can always go back ðŸ˜‰</p>
