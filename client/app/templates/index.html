    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="#" (click)="playName()">Jakub</a> and I'm a young web developer from Poland with a passion for creating beautiful accessible frontends and efficient backends for the web that your company can safely rely on.</p>
    <p>I love traveling, meeting new people and taking pictures, some of which you can see on my Instagram profile. I've been to most countries of Europe and this summer Iâ€™m going to North America (Canada, USA and Mexico). I also enjoy music, TV shows, and video games sometimes ðŸ˜€</p>
    <p>I can code and design webpages, design and manage databases, Linux and Windows servers as well as computer networks. Iâ€™m proficient with with Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and intermediate with C# and Java. I know most popular frameworks and preprocessors for them. If you want to see examples of what I can do head over to the <a [routerLink]="['/Experience']">Experience</a> tab, I also really love to learn and take on new things so even if you donâ€™t find something I might be up for a challenge.</p>
    <p>I'm a student in Computer Science class of Technical High School of Mechatronics no. 1 in Warsaw. Iâ€™m proficient in written and spoken English and Polish, and Iâ€™m trying to teach myself Russian. Iâ€™ve received few certificates in various fields of IT which you can see in the <a [routerLink]="['/Education']">Education</a> section of the website. I love learning new stuff, but I prefer to do it practically and when itâ€™s interesting for me so I don't plan on going to college. I'll rather focus on self-development and broaden my experience by work and if it doesn't work out I can always go back ðŸ˜‰</p>
