When Saloon was acquired in September 2015, it has distributed over seventy thousands of dollars worth of in game items as prizes. It was a massive learning experience in software development, but I also somewhat unexpectedly learned how to manage a team and work with a large distributed group of likeminded people from all across the world.</p>\n    ",
