    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="#" (click)="playName()">Jakub</a> and I'm a young web developer from Poland with a passion for creating beautiful accessible frontends and efficient backends for the web that your company can safely rely on.</p>
    <p>I love traveling and taking pictures wich you can see on my <a href="https://instagram.com/19kuba22">Instagram</a> profile. I've been to most countries of Europe and I plan on traveling across North America this summer (Montreal to Tijuana). I also love listening to <a href="https://soundcloud.com/kuba-chronowski-1">music</a>, watching TV shows, reading and meeting new people ðŸ˜€</p>
    <p>Despite my young age I have a lot of <a [routerLink]="['/Experience']">experience</a> regarding both programming and project management backed by my previous projects as computers were my passion since the youngest age. I am proficient with Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and intermediate with C# and Java. I know preprocessors like TypeScript, CoffeeScript, Sass or Less and frameworks like Angular, Bootstrap, Bourbon, Neat, Pylons, Pyramid and I really love to take on new things being a fast learner, so you can hit me up with virtually any challenge.</p>
    <p>I'm graduating from Computer Science class of Technical High School of Mechatronics no. 1 in Warsaw. Iâ€™m proficient in written and spoken English and Polish, and Iâ€™m trying to teach myself Russian. Iâ€™ve received certificates in various fields of IT which you can see in <a [routerLink]="['/Education']">Education</a> section of the website. I love learning new stuff, but I prefer to do it practically and when itâ€™s interesting for me which is the reason I don't plan on going to college. I'll rather focus on self-development and broaden my experience by work. If it doesn't work out I can always go back.</p>

    <p>Regards, Jakub</p>
