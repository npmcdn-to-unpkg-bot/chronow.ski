    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>My name is <a href="#" (click)="playName()">Jakub</a> and I'm a young web developer from Poland with a passion for creating beautiful accessible frontends and efficient backends for the web that your company can safely rely on.</p>
    <p>Despite my young age I have a lot of experience regarding both programming and project management backed by my previous projects as computers were my passion since the youngest age. I am proficient with Python, PHP, JavaScript (CoffeScript, TypeScript), HTML and CSS (Sass) and intermediate with PHP, C# and Java, but I really love to take on new things and I consider myself a fast learner, so you can hit me up with any challenge.</p>
    <p>I'm currently a student of Computer Science class of Technical High School of Mechatronics nr 1 in Warsaw. I love education, I love learning new stuff, but I prefer to do it by myself and only in fields that are of my interest which is why I don't plan on going to college, I'll rather focus on self-development and broaden my experience by work. If it doesn't work out I can always go back.</p>
    <p>I love to travel and take pictures some of wich you can see on my <a href="https://instagram.com/19kuba22">Instagram</a> profile. I've been to most countries of Europe and I plan on traveling across North America this summer (Montreal to Tijuana). I also want to experience life abroad close or far, doesn't matter as long as it's somewhere interesting, finally get out of Warsaw for longer and see how life is elsewhere.</p>
