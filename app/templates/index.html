    <p>My name is Jakub <a href="#" (click)="playName()">(<i class="fa fa-volume-up"></i> iÌ¯akub)</a> and I'm a young web professional based in Warsaw, Poland with a passion for creating beautiful accessible frontends and efficient backends for the web that your company can safely rely on.</p>
    <p>Despite my young age I have a lot of experience regarding both programming and project management backed by my previous projects. I am proficient with Python, PHP, JavaScript (CoffeScript, TypeScript), HTML and CSS (Sass) and intermediate with C# and Java, but I really love to take on new things and I consider myself a fast learner.</p>
